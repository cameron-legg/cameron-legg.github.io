                <p>By doing research, I found out that my family came from a group of immigrants called the Volga Germans. These people were Germans that lived in Russia, meaning that Germans immigrated to Russia because of issues and corruption in Germany to Russia. The Volga Germans lived in Russia, but kept the German language, practiced Catholicism, and had much German culture. After many generations, these Volga Germans then immigrated to the United States from Russia. They made small towns in rural areas and farmed to make money. This all occurred on my mom's side of the family.</p>
				<p>Sadly, I was not able to find any information on my dad's side of the family. Ancestry had nothing, and my dad barely knows anything about his family either, so I had no option there.</p>
				<p>Throughout my research, I was able to get to the early 1800s. This allowed me to create a large family tree to see who I am made up of. Ancestry allowed me to see where people were born and where they died. I learned I have many more ancestors than I thought and it shows me how many people a single person can be made up of.</p>
				<p>I also saw how many people within my family died because of war. I had ancestors that fought in Wold War I and World War II. This shows how much of an influence war causes on people, families, and even immigrant groups.</p>
				<p>Who am I really? I am an American. My ancestors worked extremely hard to put me here and I am thankful for all of the work they have done to put me in this country.</p>
				<p>My research showed me how much work my ancestors went through to land me on Earth in a safe place to live my life. My ancestors make me feel valuable and make me have a different point of view on life. It lets me know how important family really is to me.</p>
